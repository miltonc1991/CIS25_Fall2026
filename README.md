Assignment 1: Data Types

What it does:
Prints a welcome message and shows the size of basic data types: int, float, and char.

Why:
To learn about basic data types and using cout.

How to run:
Compile and run the program with a C++ compiler.

Assignment 2: Item Cost Calculator

What it does:
Asks the user for an item name, quantity, and cost, then calculates the total cost.

Why:
To practice taking user input, displaying output, and doing basic math.

How to run:

Assignment 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

What it does:
Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. You can also view instructions or a fun fact.

Why:
To practice functions, random numbers, and menus.

How to run:

Assignment 6:

What It Does:
This program lets the user search for an item inside a small game inventory.
Each item has a name and an ID number.
The program asks the user for an ID, then uses binary search to find the item and show its name.

How to Run:
Open the code in a C++ compiler (like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or an online compiler).

Click Run or Compile and Run.

When asked, type an ID number between 1 and 5.

The program will tell you if the item was found or not.

Why:
This assignment shows how to use:

Structs to store related information (item name and ID).

Dynamic memory allocation with new and delete[].

Binary search to quickly find items in a sorted list.
